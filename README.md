- [Redux Persist](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux-persist) - For saving state in local storage

### What I learned

Things I learned:

- How to properly structure React/Redux project files.
- How to set up Redux Toolkit inside React application.
- How to create Redux Toolkit "Slices" and create reducers and actions.
- Polished my skills with Styled Components library
- How to use React-Redux "useDispatch" and "useSelector" hooks.

### Continued development

In future projects with React/Redux I would like to focus on:

- Connecting Redux to the backend/API, using Redux Thunk
- Work on more complex application
- Implement User authentication and authorization
